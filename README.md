# University Projects
This repository contains various projects developed during my university studies in Computer Science and Engineering at Carlos III University. Each folder will contain an independent project (or projects) developed in each subject.

This repository is intended for educational purposes only. If you are a student in the same field, do not copy the code directly. Use it for learning, inspiration, and exploring possible implementations.

# Included Projects
To provide a clearer understanding of the learning progression, the projects are ordered by academic year, covering all four years of study.

## 1️⃣1942 Game Implementation (Programming) / Programación
This was the first ever coding project I've ever made, on the first year. We learned the basics of programming logic and OOP by implementing a simple arcade game. **Python** was used for all the project, with Pyxel as the game engine.

## 1️⃣Data Structures and Algorithms / Estructura de Datos y Algoritmos
A subject oriented to learn all the different data structures like linked lists, trees and graphs. For the project, we were asked to implement some of these structures and implement some functions to work with them. All the code was written in **Python**.

## 1️⃣Computer Technology / Tecnología de Computadores
This subject objective was to understand the usage of transistors and logic gates. We used **VHDL** to control a fpga in the university laboratory. In the reports, there is all the information required by the laboratory teachers.

## 2️⃣Computer Structure / Estructura de Computadores
On this subject, we worked with assembly **(RISC-V)** and microprogramming processors to understand the most basic behaviour of a computer and how are the operations performed. 

The first project was developed with the help of the CREATOR simulator developed by the university. The second project was developed using the WepSim simulator for microinstructions.

The optional project was a light delivery that tested the behaviour of a program that operated over a matrix. The program was run on a ESP32-C3 microprocessor and on CREATOR simulator, to highlight the importance of a cache when working with large data in memory.

## 2️⃣Files and Data Bases / Ficheros y Bases de Datos
A subject oriented to learn the basics of relational data bases and file's internal structure. We used **Oracle SQL developer** to implement the databases we were asked for.

## 2️⃣Artificial Intelligence / Inteligencia Artificial
This subject aims to teach us the basics of Bayesian networks and Fuzzy logic. The project developed was an implementation of a fuzzy logic prediction system in **Python**

## 2️⃣Software Development / Desarrollo de Software
On this subject, we learned the basics of developing a profesional application as software developers, usign **Python**. Altough the project is pretty simple, the subject is oriented to teach us how to work in large groups using the correct methodologies.

## 2️⃣Operative Systems / Sistemas Operativos
By far, one of my favourite subjects. We learned to implement more complex data structures, to work with processes and threads. We learned concurrency and memory consistency. All the project was written in **C**.

## 3️⃣Computer Architecture / Arquitectura de Computadores
A subject oriented to learn the usage of several optimizations to help improve the code developed. The final project was an image processor that allows several operations over the PPM format. All the code was developed in **C++** and we were imposed some coding standards and rules in order to improve our skills.

## 3️⃣Heurístics and Optimization / Heurística y Optimización
This subject's projects were oriented to optimization and solving of mathematically complex problems. We used several tools like the **calc-solver and mathprog** for the first practise. For the second one, we had to implement a program that solved an heuristic search problem. In order to achieve a better performance, we chose to use **C++** rather than Python or other higher level languages.

## 3️⃣User Interfaces / Interfaces de Usuario
In this subject we learned to develop web pages using **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. The first two were more simple, while the final delivery was far more complex. The work carried out by my partners was crucial for this project.

## 3️⃣Criptography and Security / Criptografía y Seguridad
For this project, we were asked to develop any software application and to implement the criptography techniques we learned in the subject. The project was developed on **Python**, using **SQLite** for the data and **Tkinter** for a basic interface.
